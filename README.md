# N queen problem solving and process time comparison between Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithm

It working with Python 3 !

## Usage
Hill Climbing Algorithm
```bash
python nqueen.py -hc
```
Genetic Algorithm
```bash
python nqueen.py -ga
```

For print detailed results
```bash
python nqueen.py -hc -p
python nqueen.py -ga -p
```

Default board size is 8, for genetic algorithm default population size is 10
